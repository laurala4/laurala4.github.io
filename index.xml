      <description>In “Taxable Income of MY Entire Working Life So Far” u/BeardedFetus, presents graphically from 1994 to 2018 his/her income per year before graduating from college and after. This is a simple and easy to understand graph. His/her comments about it are that this is a “crappy chart”. Not crappy at all. Very easy to understand, using colors to better understanding. Yellow lines across to highlight levels every $25,000 dollars. it is very easy to see that his/her income was always under $25,000 from 1994 to 2011 at which time he/she graduated from college.</description>
